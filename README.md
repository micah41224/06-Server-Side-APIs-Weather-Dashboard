# 06-Server-Side-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

## Project Description

This week's assignment required that I build a weather forecasting app that pulled data from the third party API "openweathermap.org". This data was used to fill out both a current conditions list and a 5 day forecast. The information displayed for the current day includes: city name, current date, an icon showing the current weather, the temperature in fahrenheit, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index which displays with a background color indicating the severity of current conditions. The information displayed for the 5 day forcast includes the date of the day following today (does not include current date as that is displayed above) and the 4 days following it as well as an icon showing the predicted weather conditions for each day, the predicted temperature in fahrenheit, the predicted wind speed and the predicted humidity.

In order to choose what city forecast is displayed, the user can enter the city of their choosing in the input element to the upper left section of the page. Once typed out they can click search and the forecast will populate to the right side of the page (both current and 5 day). When the user clicks search the city that they input will be saved to local storage and will appear in the section below the search area. The user can store as many cities as they like and if they click on one of the stored cities the weather forecast for that city will manifest as if they had searched it using the above input element.

## Technologies Used:
